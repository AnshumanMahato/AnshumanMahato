<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 - Good First Post!!! 
 <p>Let's start with stating that this is my very first post on "dev.to". It's been a few months since I came to know about this platform. I came across this platform while working on HacktoberFest2020 (By the way, it was my first HacktoberFest as well). </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ajMQTmyU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/drrkc80epcadpljzyqlo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ajMQTmyU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/drrkc80epcadpljzyqlo.png" alt="Alt Text"></a></p>

<p>When I came here, at first, it seemed to me like a blog. But then, I realised that it's not just a simple blog, but a social media platform that focuses primarily on developers. A community of coders.</p>

<p>Until now, I did not have any plans to post here. Just came here to get some tutorials, read some stuff and that was all I did here. But recently, I had this idea of documenting my coding journey. And "DEV.To" seemed like a really great option for this purpose. And this is where I begin. From here onwards, I have decided that this year, I'll be posting one article every week regarding whatever I'd be learning in that week. </p>

<p>Wishing you guys a Very Happy New Year!!! </p>
